    <!-- <h1>Case Study: Centralizing Software Asset Management for a Major Telecommunications Provider</h1> -->

    <section>
        <h2>Client Overview</h2><br />
        <p>Our client is a leading telecommunications company with over 100,000 employees. Operating in a complex, decentralized environment with multiple business units, the client faced significant challenges in managing its software estate. The company had partnerships with hundreds of software vendors, with software products and usage scattered across various departments. As a result, the company recognized the need for a unified, centralized approach to software management to optimize costs and ensure visibility across the entire organization.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Challenge</h2><br />
        <p>The client was spending a disproportionately high amount on software compared to industry standards. The lack of a centralized view meant that software usage, purchasing, and contract management were inefficient and decentralized. The key challenges included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fragmented Software Management:</strong> Software assets and their usage were dispersed across different business units, making it difficult to track and manage effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Inefficiency in Software Procurement:</strong> The decentralized approach led to redundant software purchases and underutilized assets.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost Overruns:</strong> Without a centralized platform, the company struggled to assess software spending accurately and optimize costs.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Solution</h2><br />
        <p>We implemented a two-phase approach to address these challenges:</p>
        
        <br /><h6>Phase 1: Cost Optimization</h6>
        <p>Phase 1 focused on reducing the client’s overall software spend. Dotsito analyzed the client’s contractual and financial data, engaging with key stakeholders across the organization to evaluate the feasibility of our proposed cost-saving strategies.</p>
        <p>Our activities in Phase 1 included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Reviewing software contracts, financial data, and usage patterns to identify inefficiencies and potential savings.</li>
            <li><strong>Stakeholder Engagement:</strong> Collaborating with various business units to assess the impact of the proposed savings and understand the operational constraints.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost Reduction Hypotheses:</strong> Formulating and testing hypotheses around software consolidation, license optimization, and renegotiation of contracts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The result of Phase 1 was a clear roadmap to significantly reduce software-related expenditures by eliminating redundant licenses, optimizing software usage, and renegotiating vendor contracts.</p>

        <br /><h6>Phase 2: Establishing In-House SAM Capability</h6>
        <p>Concurrently, Phase 2 focused on transforming the client’s Software Asset Management (SAM) capabilities. Dotsito supported the client in establishing an in-house SAM function, which would empower the organization to manage and optimize their software assets independently in the future.</p>
        <p>Key activities in Phase 2 included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SAM Tool Configuration:</strong> We worked closely with the client to align on operational requirements for the SAM tool and facilitated its configuration.</li>
            <li><strong>Workshops and Training:</strong> We conducted workshops to ensure the client’s team was equipped with the knowledge and skills required to operate the SAM tool effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Implementation Support:</strong> Dotsito provided hands-on support during the implementation phase, ensuring a smooth deployment and integration of the SAM tool into the client's operational environment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By the end of Phase 2, the client had successfully established an internal SAM capability, allowing them to continuously monitor, track, and optimize their software assets.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Results</h2><br />
        <p>The outcomes of both phases were transformative for the client:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Significant Cost Savings:</strong> In Phase 1, the client realized immediate savings through contract renegotiations, license optimization, and the elimination of unused or redundant software.</li>
            <li><strong>Operational Efficiency:</strong> The SAM tool provided the client with a centralized and streamlined process for managing software assets, reducing manual effort and increasing visibility.</li>
            <li><strong>In-House SAM Capability:</strong> By the end of Phase 2, the client’s internal team was fully capable of managing their software assets, with full operational control and a clear path for ongoing optimization.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2><br />
        <p>Through a phased approach focused on cost optimization and the establishment of an in-house Software Asset Management capability, Dotsito helped the client reduce software spend, increase efficiency, and set the foundation for ongoing, sustainable software management. The project not only delivered immediate savings but also empowered the client with the tools and knowledge needed to continuously optimize their software estate in the future.</p>
