                <li><p><strong>Incident Prioritization:</strong> Use AI to categorize and prioritize incidents based on severity and impact.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Automated Workflows:</strong> Streamline incident response by automating ticket creation, escalation, and resolution.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Example:</strong> A financial institution reduced response times by 40% using SIR to automate phishing attack mitigation.</p></li>
            </ul>

           <br /><h6>2. Comprehensive Threat Intelligence</h6>
            <p>ServiceNow’s Threat Intelligence module integrates threat data from multiple sources to provide actionable insights. This enables security teams to proactively address vulnerabilities and mitigate risks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Threat Correlation:</strong> Consolidate data from threat feeds, logs, and sensors for better visibility.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>AI-Driven Insights:</strong> Use machine learning to identify patterns and predict emerging threats.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Integration:</strong> Combine threat intelligence with incident response for a unified approach to security.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Example:</strong> A healthcare provider leveraged Threat Intelligence to prevent ransomware attacks by analyzing suspicious activity patterns.</p></li>
            </ul>

           <br /><h6>3. Proactive Vulnerability Management</h6>
            <p>The Vulnerability Response (VR) module helps organizations identify and remediate vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Key capabilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Risk Scoring:</strong> Assess vulnerabilities based on potential impact and prioritize remediation efforts.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Patch Management:</strong> Automate the deployment of patches to reduce exposure to known threats.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Compliance Reporting:</strong> Generate reports to demonstrate compliance with security standards.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Example:</strong> A manufacturing company reduced its attack surface by 60% using VR to automate patch management processes.</p></li>
            </ul>

           <br /><h6>4. Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)</h6>
            <p>The GRC module aligns IT security practices with regulatory and corporate requirements, ensuring organizations maintain robust compliance frameworks.</p>
            <ul>
