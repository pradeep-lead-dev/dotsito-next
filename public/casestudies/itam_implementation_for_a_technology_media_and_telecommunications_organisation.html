        <h2>Client Overview</h2><br />
        <p>Our client consists of two large international media organisations that recently merged. They sought a partner to lead their ServiceNow technology transformation project to ensure that both organisations' tooling, people, processes, data models, and architecture were aligned for the interim ServiceNow estate (‘Pre-Convergence’) before transitioning to a unified technology platform (“Convergence”) for their day-to-day operations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Challenge</h2><br />
        <p>The merger of two large organisations presented significant challenges in aligning systems, processes, and workflows. Each organisation had its own tooling, processes, and architecture, which needed to be harmonised for the interim period before convergence. The key challenges included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tooling Integration:</strong> Different ServiceNow configurations and third-party tools needed to be integrated for the interim period.</li>
            <li><strong>Process Alignment:</strong> Aligning different processes and workflows between the two organisations to create a unified approach.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Model Harmonisation:</strong> Ensuring consistency and accuracy of data models across both organisations, preparing for future integration.</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-Convergence Alignment:</strong> Designing a system that could support both organisations' needs while preparing for full convergence onto a single platform.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Solution</h2><br />
        <p>We implemented a phased approach to address the challenges, focusing on aligning both organisations’ ServiceNow tooling, processes, data models, and architecture during the ‘Pre-Convergence’ phase, while preparing them for future convergence:</p>

        <br /><h6>Phase 1: Workshops and Blueprint Creation</h6>
        <p>We conducted workshops with key stakeholders from both organisations to understand their current state, including people, processes, tooling, and data. The workshops helped us gather the necessary information to create a blueprint of the current state and then design the target architecture and data models.</p>
        <p>Key activities in Phase 1 included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Workshops with Stakeholders:</strong> Engaged stakeholders from both organisations to gather requirements and insights on the current state.</li>
            <li><strong>Blueprint Creation:</strong> Designed a blueprint of the current state, including tooling, processes, people, and data, and mapped out the potential target architecture and data models.</li>
        </ul>

        <br /><h6>Phase 2: Implementation of ServiceNow Modules and Integrations</h6>
        <p>In Phase 2, based on the agreed target architecture and data model, we implemented the necessary ServiceNow modules and integrations to bring the organisations' systems in line with the unified strategy. This included the implementation of Hardware Asset Management (HAM) Pro and Software Asset Management (SAM) Pro modules, as well as configuring and integrating third-party tools.</p>
        <p>Key activities in Phase 2 included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Implementation of HAM and SAM Modules:</strong> Implemented Hardware Asset Management (HAM) Pro and Software Asset Management (SAM) Pro modules, including Software Asset Workspace, SaaS Licence Management, and Opt-in content services.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrations and Configurations:</strong> Integrated various third-party systems, such as SCCM, Jamf, Ariba, Roadmunk, Adobe CC, Jira, and O365, into the ServiceNow platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Entitlement Import:</strong> Imported software and hardware entitlement data to align with the new system.</li>
            <li><strong>KPI Design:</strong> Designed Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for both HAM and SAM to measure the effectiveness of asset management and software lifecycle processes.</li>
            <li><strong>Process and Workflow Modifications:</strong> Modified existing HAM and SAM lifecycle processes and workflows (e.g., Asset RMA, Software Request) to ensure alignment with the new architecture and processes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the end of Phase 2, both organisations had successfully integrated their hardware and software asset management functions into a unified platform, ensuring alignment for the interim period while preparing for future convergence.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2><br />
        <p>The outcomes of the project were transformative for the client:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Streamlined Asset Management:</strong> The client achieved streamlined hardware and software asset management processes through the implementation of HAM and SAM Pro modules, with real-time tracking and insights.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrated Tooling:</strong> The integration of third-party systems ensured that both organisations were able to work seamlessly within the ServiceNow platform during the ‘Pre-Convergence’ phase.</li>
            <li><strong>Aligned Processes and Workflows:</strong> The harmonisation of processes and workflows improved collaboration and operational efficiency between the two organisations.</li>
            <li><strong>Clear Path to Convergence:</strong> With the foundation set for future convergence, the client now had a clear roadmap for transitioning to a single, unified ServiceNow platform.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2><br />
        <p>Through a phased approach focused on aligning tooling, processes, data models, and architecture during the merger, Dotsito helped the client successfully integrate their ServiceNow systems in preparation for full convergence. The outcome not only streamlined asset management but also empowered both organisations with the tools and strategies needed for a seamless transition to a unified platform in the future.</p>
