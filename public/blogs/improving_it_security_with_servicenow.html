            <h2>How ServiceNow Enhances IT Security</h2><br/>            <p>ServiceNow's security modules deliver significant advantages by automating key processes and integrating seamlessly with existing IT infrastructure. Here’s how they enhance IT security:</p>

           <br /><h6>1. Automated Threat Detection and Incident Response</h6>
            <p>ServiceNow's Security Incident Response (SIR) module automates the entire lifecycle of security incidents, from detection to resolution. Key features include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Alerts:</strong> Detect security incidents instantly and notify the appropriate teams.</li>
                <li><strong>Incident Prioritization:</strong> Use AI to categorize and prioritize incidents based on severity and impact.</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Workflows:</strong> Streamline incident response by automating ticket creation, escalation, and resolution.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> A financial institution reduced response times by 40% using SIR to automate phishing attack mitigation.</li>
            </ul>

           <br /><h6>2. Comprehensive Threat Intelligence</h6>
            <p>ServiceNow’s Threat Intelligence module integrates threat data from multiple sources to provide actionable insights. This enables security teams to proactively address vulnerabilities and mitigate risks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Threat Correlation:</strong> Consolidate data from threat feeds, logs, and sensors for better visibility.</li>
                <li><strong>AI-Driven Insights:</strong> Use machine learning to identify patterns and predict emerging threats.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Combine threat intelligence with incident response for a unified approach to security.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> A healthcare provider leveraged Threat Intelligence to prevent ransomware attacks by analyzing suspicious activity patterns.</li>
            </ul>

           <br /><h6>3. Proactive Vulnerability Management</h6>
            <p>The Vulnerability Response (VR) module helps organizations identify and remediate vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Key capabilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Risk Scoring:</strong> Assess vulnerabilities based on potential impact and prioritize remediation efforts.</li>
                <li><strong>Patch Management:</strong> Automate the deployment of patches to reduce exposure to known threats.</li>
                <li><strong>Compliance Reporting:</strong> Generate reports to demonstrate compliance with security standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> A manufacturing company reduced its attack surface by 60% using VR to automate patch management processes.</li>
            </ul>

           <br /><h6>4. Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)</h6>
            <p>The GRC module aligns IT security practices with regulatory and corporate requirements, ensuring organizations maintain robust compliance frameworks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Risk Assessments:</strong> Identify, evaluate, and mitigate risks across the organization.</li>
