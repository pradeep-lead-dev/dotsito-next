        <h2>Client Overview</h2><br />
        <p>Our client is a multinational banking and financial services corporation with over 100,000 employees. The company operates within a complex, decentralized structure with numerous business units functioning independently. This was particularly evident in the realm of business services, where multiple vendors were relied upon for support. The client recognised the need for a holistic view of their service landscape. Their primary challenge was the lack of visibility into service health and key performance indicators. They sought to transition from server-centric management to service-centric management.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Challenge</h2><br />
        <p>The client’s key challenge was a lack of visibility into the health of their services and critical performance metrics. The main issues included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Decentralised Operations:</strong> Business units were operating independently, making it difficult to have a unified view of services and their performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Service Visibility:</strong> There was no comprehensive visibility into the health and performance of the services, hindering effective decision-making and management.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Automation:</strong> The absence of automated tools meant significant manual effort was required to consolidate data and track services.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Solution</h2><br />
        <p>We implemented a solution that focused on improving service visibility, streamlining operations, and automating the identification of IT elements across the client’s infrastructure.</p>

        <br /><h6>Phase 1: Current State Assessment</h6>
        <p>We conducted interviews with key stakeholders across various support teams and business units to assess the current state of service management. Through these interviews, we identified process gaps and areas for improvement relative to industry best practices.</p>
        <p>Key activities in Phase 1 included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stakeholder Interviews:</strong> Engaged with business units and support teams to assess the current service management processes.</li>
            <li><strong>Process Gap Analysis:</strong> Identified gaps in existing processes and tools, highlighting the need for better visibility and automation.</li>
        </ul>

        <br /><h6>Phase 2: Implementation of ServiceNow Discovery and CMDB</h6>
        <p>In Phase 2, we implemented ServiceNow Discovery, an automation tool designed to simplify the identification of all IT elements and their interconnections. This significantly reduced manual labor and the need to consolidate offline data.</p>
        <p>Key activities in Phase 2 included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ServiceNow Discovery:</strong> We implemented ServiceNow Discovery to automatically identify and map all IT elements, including on-premises, cloud, and serverless resources.</li>
            <li><strong>CMDB Integration:</strong> The data from Discovery was integrated into the Configuration Management Database (CMDB), providing a unified view of IT assets and their relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Mapping:</strong> We created a comprehensive service map using the CMDB data. This visual representation of IT services, their components, and dependencies provided the client with full visibility into service health and performance.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Results</h2><br />
        <p>The solution delivered several key benefits to the client:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Automated Service Discovery:</strong> The implementation of ServiceNow Discovery automated the identification of IT resources and services, reducing manual effort and eliminating errors from offline data.</li>
            <li><strong>Comprehensive Service Map:</strong> The client gained a clear, visual representation of IT services and their interdependencies, which improved decision-making and service management.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Service Visibility:</strong> With the CMDB and service map, the client now had full visibility into service health, enabling proactive monitoring and management.</li>
            <li><strong>Streamlined Operations:</strong> By consolidating data into a central repository, the client was able to streamline their operations and improve efficiency across business units.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2><br />
        <p>Through the implementation of ServiceNow Discovery and CMDB, Dotsito enabled the client to gain comprehensive visibility into their service landscape. The automated discovery process, combined with a detailed service map, allowed the client to transition from a server-centric to a service-centric approach, improving service health monitoring, performance tracking, and overall operational efficiency.</p>
